### HomeComponent Documentation

**Description:**
The `HomeComponent` is an asynchronous React component that fetches data from an API endpoint, validates the response, and renders either the `CompoundComponent` (with the fetched data) or the `ErrorComponent` (with the error message) based on the API response status.
utilizes the Client-Server Composition Pattern, which facilitates efficient data-fetching and server-side rendering.
---

**Features:**
1. **Asynchronous Data Fetching:**  
   - Fetches data from an API endpoint defined by combining the environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` and `trackingPath`.
   - Utilizes the `next` option in the fetch configuration to revalidate data every 200 seconds.

2. **Conditional Rendering:**  
   - Renders the `CompoundComponent` when the API response is successful (`response.ok`).
   - Renders the `ErrorComponent` when the API response indicates an error.

---

**Key Components:**
- **`CompoundComponent`**: Displays data fetched from the API in a coordinated map and table view.
- **`ErrorComponent`**: Displays an error message when the API request fails.

---

**Props:**
No props are directly passed to `HomeComponent`. The data fetching and error handling occur internally within the component.

---

**Implementation Details:**
1. **API Integration:**  
   - Fetches data from the endpoint `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL}${trackingPath}`.
   - Uses environment variables to ensure flexibility in different deployment environments.

2. **Error Handling:**  
   - Handles both API success (`response.ok`) and failure scenarios by conditionally rendering appropriate components.

3. **Scalability:**  
   - Designed with reusable components (`CompoundComponent` and `ErrorComponent`) for scalability.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
import HomeComponent from "./HomeComponent";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome</h1>
      <HomeComponent />
    </div>
  );
}
